# Predictive-Modeling

This repository shall contain codes that show examples of time series forecasting.

Time series forecasting/Predictive Modeling/Predictive Analysis is when Time Series Data is used to predict future outcomes.
One of the most common examples in this would be to predict Stock Market Prices given some previous data.

1. CNN_Time_Series: A very simple program that predicts the output of a handmade univariate time series data. A 1D CNN has been used for this example.

2. Multiple Input Series_CNN: A simple program using 1D CNN that makes predictions based on multivariate time series data. Time series data has to be arranged into a sliding window format, for that time sequence =3 has been used in this example. This shows one such way of handling multiple input features.
